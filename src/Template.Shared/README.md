# Shared

Here should only be things that can be shared between all projects. It should be a small project. Try to avoid making it a big ball of mud.

Structure can differ depending on the requirements. 

Examples:
* [Extension methods](./Extensions/README.md) - solution wide extension methods
* [Services](./Services/README.md) - shared services
